    <p>My name is Abiodun Adenike, i've always had a passion for storytelling which led to pursue a degree
        in Mass Communication at Lagos State University. However, after graduating, i felt a pull forward
        the dynamic world of technology. Encouraged by my analytical skills and eagerness to learn, i 
        enrolled at AltSchool Africa to begin my journey into tech.
<br>
        The transition wasn't easy. I found myself navigating unfamiliar terrain, learning to code, and grappling
        with concepts that often seemed daunting. Yet, i embraced each challenge with determination, seeing every
        obstacle as an opportunity to grow. The supportive community at AltSchool Africa helped me realize that
        i wasn't alone in this journey.
<br>
        During late-night study sessions, R&B music became my constant companion, soothing my mind and keeping
        my spirits high. When i needed a break from screens, i immersed myself in novels, letting stories whisk 
        me away to different worlds.
